An Alpha fork/re-implementation of Ex Nihilo Creatio for the Fabric modloader.

Do you love Skyblocks? Do you hate having one block that takes you from minute 5 to year 5? Then this is the mod for you!

Ex Nihilo Fabrico is a fork of Ex Nihilo Creatio for the Fabric modloader on 1.14. Ex Nihilo Creatio was a fork of Ex Nihilo Adscensio for 1.12, which was itself a continuation of the Ex Nihilo mod from 1.7.10, rewritten from the ground up.

The core concepts remain the same, but with a few key additions to give a little extra progression.

* Sieve blocks for resources, but now the sieve can take different meshes and be "water"logged.
* Each mesh and "water"logging fluid gives potentially different results, so check carefully.
* Sieve meshes can also be enchanted in a vanilla crafting table to give an extra boost to your efficiency (or fortune).
* Hammers now respect a mining level. No more using a wooden hammer for everything!
* Witchwater is back!
* Mob Dolls are back!
* Barrels are back! They can also potentially compost to something that isn't dirt, if you choose.
* Silk Worms are back! (And easier to see)
* Crucibles are back! And can potentially melt down to things that aren't lava...
* The Broken/Crushed/Powdered Ore system has been replaced with a simple "Piece / Chunk" system. I felt like the old system served as nothing more than a nuisance, and ended up with something like this anyway.
